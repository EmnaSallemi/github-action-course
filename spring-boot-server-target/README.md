## üíªTarget Room Backend Projectüíª



### üí° Why Spring Boot 
Spring Boot offers a combination of rapid development and various features that make building backend applications efficient and effective.
 - Microservices Architecture: It provides features and tools that support building, deploying...
 -  Auto-Configuration: automatically configures application components based on the project's dependencies.
 - Dependency Management:that offers a powerful dependency management system that helps manage and resolve dependencies with minimal effort.
 - Testing Support: including the ability to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### üöÄ What is Idea of project 

The idea consists of Ranging Target Room application implemented as an Angular  application, and a ``RESTful web service`` implemented as a Spring Boot application, that communicate via a ``REST API`` .

The back-end adheres to the Model-View-Controller``MVC`` architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and streamlined development. This separation of concerns enhances code readability, as each component focuses on its designated role.

This application executes some GET requests on the web server to display target and product aivalability on the user interface.

 It then processes these request to properly display the availability of those tools and provide the necessary operations to manage data, such as adding new records, retrieving existing data, updating information, and removing records from the underlying data source while using ```CRUD``` application.

### üì¢ Use Target Room Backend in 4 steps

1. Setup by installing Java Development Kit (JDK) and development environment (IDE).

2. Configure MySQL database  in the ```application.properties``` .

3. Implement API Endpoints.
4. Test Your Application by running your Spring Boot application ```Run java ```.

### üîê Instalation Prerequisites:

- Install Java Development Kit (JDK):

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
- Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html#requirements), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) .

-  Install [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/) Database.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
#### Instalation

1. Clone repo
```
https://github.com/EmnaSallemi/full-stack-targetroom-internship.git
```
2. Installing Dependencies:
  ```mvn install```

3. Run Development Server using Java-based application: 
```run java```

 4. Testing code while using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)



#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

# TargetRoom

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
